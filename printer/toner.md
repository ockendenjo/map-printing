# Toner

The SROC printer takes canon 711 cartridges in 4 colours. A full set of toner 
cartridges can cost over £400 if bought from Canon, or less than £100 if bought on ebay.
The colours are used at different rates, with yellow being the most used colour. 

## Toner low

The printer will indicate when the toner is running low, and at some point will
refuse to continue printing. At this point, take the cartridge out of the printer,
give it a good shake and return to the printer. After a bit of time, the printer
will continue printing. However, it might only do 5-10 pages before it stops again.
Eventually taking the cartridge out and shaking it will be slowing down printing 
too much and will be time to use a replacement cartridge.

## Spare cartridges

I used to keep a spare cartridge of each colour in case there was a large print
job and one of the cartridges ran out.

There are a variety of different cartridges available to buy. 
I went for the Genuine Canon cartridges on eBay. Sometimes they weren't in
their original box. They were a lot cheaper (80%) than buying from Canon and
seemed to be of a similar quality.

## Recycling

Canon has a toner recycling programme - see their website. Essentially you
get a Royal Mail parcel label to attach to the toner box, and then can drop it
off at a post office to be returned for recycling.
