# Map printing

I no longer print the maps for SROC races, but the following information may still be helpful for planners.

There are also some instructions [here](./printer/README.md) which might be useful to the map printer.

## Things to check

### Page margins
The page margins should be at least 5mm (recommended 7mm) to ensure nothing gets cut off by the printer. [More details...](instructions/page-margins.md)

### Control descriptions size
The box size of the control descriptions should be between 5 and 7mm when printed. [More details...](instructions/descriptions-size.md)

### Course closing time
Add the course closing time as the last line in the control descriptions. [More details...](instructions/course-closing.md)

### Add course name
It might be useful to add the course name in large pink letters somewhere on the map. [More details...](instructions/course-name.md)
