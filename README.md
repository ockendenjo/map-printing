# Map printing

## Initial contact
Please get in contact approximately one month before the maps are needed with the following information:
* Date you'd like to collect the maps
* Approximate number of maps to be printed

## Final files
Please send me the final set of files at least one week before the maps will be collected. 


## Things to check

### Control descriptions size
The box size of the control descriptions should be between 5 and 7mm when printed. [More details...](instructions/descriptions-size.md)

### Course closing time
Add the course closing time as the last line in the control descriptions. [More details...](instructions/course-closing.md)

### Add course name
It might be useful to add the course name in large pink letters somewhere on the map. [More details...](instructions/course-name.md)
